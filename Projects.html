                title: "Intelligent Legal Form Builder – Document Automation Platform",
                description: `
    <p>As a <strong>Solution Architect</strong>, I led the development of an advanced <strong>Legal Form Builder</strong> designed to simplify and accelerate legal document creation for attorneys and law firms. This cloud-based platform offers a dynamic, rules-driven interface to assemble complex jurisdiction-based forms with minimal manual intervention.</p>

    <p>The core of the application is a configurable <strong>form generation engine</strong> that supports:
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic field population based on jurisdiction and legal context</li>
      <li>Conditional logic for clause insertion, dependencies, and formatting</li>
      <li>Reusable templates and pre-approved language blocks</li>
      <li>Data import from prior cases or client information repositories</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Built using a modular architecture with <strong>.NET Core APIs</strong> and a responsive frontend in <strong>Angular</strong>, the platform supports:
    <ul>
      <li>Form field controls: text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, multi-sections</li>
      <li>Auto-saving drafts and versioning of form states</li>
      <li>Collaborative form filling between attorneys and clients</li>
      <li>PDF and Word document generation with jurisdiction-specific branding</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The solution integrates with existing client portals, enabling:
    <ul>
      <li>Secure document sharing</li>
      <li>Client intake via smart questionnaires</li>
      <li>Commenting, redlining, and e-signature readiness</li>
    </ul>
    Advanced user role management ensures that attorneys, paralegals, and clients interact with appropriate permissions and audit trails.</p>

    <p>Intelligence is layered using configurable metadata and logic rules, enabling form output to adapt based on input patterns. This reduces drafting errors, increases compliance with legal standards, and significantly shortens turnaround time for document preparation.</p>

                title: "Policy Evaluation Framework – Containerized Asset Compliance Engine",
                description: `
    <p>As the <strong>Solution Architect</strong>, I led the architectural design and implementation of a scalable <strong>Policy Evaluation Framework</strong> used to assess compliance of enterprise assets against defined policy sets. The system is built on a modular, container-driven architecture to support distributed execution, reusability, and rapid evaluation cycles.</p>

    <p>The core design centers around the following key components:</p>

    <h4>1. Policy Evaluator (Orchestrator Container)</h4>
    <p>This acts as the primary entry point for clients or external systems. It is responsible for:
    <ul>
      <li>Validating incoming evaluation requests</li>
      <li>Triggering asynchronous events for processing</li>
      <li>Calling RESTful APIs exposed by individual policy containers</li>
      <li>Coordinating multi-policy evaluations across various asset types</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>2. Processor Service</h4>
    <p>The processor is a long-running microservice that:
    <ul>
      <li>Listens to incoming evaluation events</li>
      <li>Invokes appropriate policy containers for logic execution</li>
      <li>Persists evaluation results, audit logs, and error handling data into the database</li>
      <li>Manages execution retries and timeout strategies</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>3. Policy Containers</h4>
    <p>Each policy is isolated in a dedicated, <strong>language-agnostic container</strong> that can be scaled independently. These containers:
    <ul>
      <li>Expose a REST API endpoint to receive evaluation data</li>
      <li>Execute the policy logic securely and return verdicts</li>
      <li>Can be spun up dynamically based on orchestration needs</li>
    </ul>
    This design ensures extensibility, allowing different teams to write policy logic in the most appropriate language or runtime.</p>

    <p>The architecture enables true horizontal scalability and clean separation of concerns between orchestration, policy logic, and event processing. With containerized policy evaluation, the system supports rapid onboarding of new compliance rules, minimizes resource coupling, and ensures robust observability.</p>

                title: "Complaint Resolution System – Operational Issue Tracking and Response Platform",
                description: `
    <p>As the <strong>Technical Lead</strong>, I led the design and implementation of a centralized <strong>Complaint Resolution System</strong> tailored for high-volume restaurant chains. The platform was developed to automate the intake, categorization, and resolution tracking of customer complaints received through multiple sources including emails, surveys, and raw feedback logs.</p>

    <p>The system aggregates complaint data from various structured and unstructured sources, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Email inbox parsing and keyword tagging</li>
      <li>Raw customer feedback files and call center exports</li>
      <li>POS-linked transactional references for root cause analysis</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Using a combination of rule-based classification and data enrichment, each complaint is:
    <ul>
      <li>Assigned to the appropriate team or location for follow-up</li>
      <li>Tracked through a resolution workflow with timestamps and SLA enforcement</li>
      <li>Linked to related root causes such as employee behavior, product quality, service delays, or operational gaps</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Managers and field leaders can interact with a dashboard built in <strong>Angular</strong> to:
    <ul>
      <li>View complaint volumes by type, store, or date</li>
      <li>Track open/closed status and time to resolution</li>
      <li>Generate KPIs on resolution trends and recurring issues</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The platform is powered by a <strong>.NET Core API layer</strong> and backed by a secure and searchable data store, enabling rapid response and continuous quality improvement. Email triggers and escalation workflows notify the right stakeholders when issues remain unresolved or breach expected thresholds.</p>

                description: `
    <p>As the <strong>Technical Lead</strong>, I contributed to the architecture and implementation of a comprehensive <strong>Forecasting Platform</strong> that leveraged <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> models to accurately predict Sales, Labor needs, and CML (Cost of Managing Labor) metrics. This platform was a critical decision-support tool for operations and workforce planning across retail and restaurant locations.</p>

    <p>The system ingested and processed large volumes of historical data including:
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-year sales and transaction trends</li>
      <li>Labor usage and shift performance patterns</li>
      <li>Weather data and seasonality impacts</li>
      <li>Cost and wage changes over time</li>
    </ul>
    These data streams were normalized and used to train pre-built and custom machine learning models capable of generating forecasts down to the hour and location level.</p>

    <p>The platform delivered predictive insights such as:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sales Forecasting</strong> – projecting revenue for planning and goal-setting</li>
      <li><strong>Labor Forecasting</strong> – determining required staffing levels for optimal service</li>
      <li><strong>Cost Forecasting</strong> – estimating labor expenses and budgeting projections</li>
    </ul>
    These forecasts directly informed labor scheduling modules and helped reduce under/over staffing and operational inefficiencies.</p>

    <p>The solution was built with a service-oriented architecture using <strong>.NET APIs</strong> for business logic orchestration and <strong>Angular</strong> for intuitive dashboarding. AI/ML models were developed and hosted as part of the backend services, exposing prediction APIs consumed by the front-end.</p>

    <p>Core capabilities include:
    <ul>
      <li>Time-series modeling for daily and intra-day predictions</li>
      <li>Scenario simulations based on weather, holidays, and promotions</li>
      <li>Role-based forecast visualizations for operators, managers, and finance teams</li>
      <li>Integration with labor scheduling systems for automatic recommendations</li>

                description: `
    <p>As a core contributor and <strong>Technical Lead</strong>, I designed and delivered an enterprise-grade <strong>Employee Scheduling Application</strong> that streamlines shift planning and workforce allocation for hourly and salaried employees. The application provides an intuitive scheduling grid, similar to calendar views, where managers can assign, adjust, and track shifts across days and departments for multiple employees.</p>

    <p>Built with a scalable <strong>Microservices Architecture</strong> using <strong>.NET Core APIs</strong> and an interactive frontend in <strong>Angular</strong>, the platform supports both single-store and multi-location scheduling operations. It enables store managers to:
    <ul>
      <li>Create recurring or ad-hoc schedules by role or department</li>
      <li>Manage availability and conflicts through real-time validations</li>
      <li>View labor coverage vs forecast in a visual grid interface</li>
      <li>Compare labor spend against budgeted hours and costs</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The scheduling grid provides a holistic weekly view that includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Shift assignments with start and end times</li>
      <li>Employee groupings (e.g., General Manager, Shift Leader, Crew)</li>
      <li>Daily and weekly labor hour summaries and cost calculations</li>
      <li>Color-coded alerts for overages, gaps, or violations</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Key platform capabilities include:
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic shift templates for consistent scheduling patterns</li>
      <li>Auto-suggestion engine based on employee availability and compliance rules</li>
      <li>Forecast integration to align labor with predicted sales and traffic</li>
      <li>Email and in-app notifications for published or changed schedules</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>In addition to labor planning, the application ties into payroll systems for accurate time tracking and cost reconciliation. Data is persisted securely in a centralized database with support for audit logs, schedule history, and role-based access control.</p>

                            <p>As the <strong>Technical Lead</strong> for the <strong>Insight Pay</strong> platform, I was responsible for designing and implementing an enterprise-grade payroll processing solution built using a scalable <strong>Microservices Architecture</strong>. The platform was specifically engineered to serve multi-location retail, franchise, and restaurant businesses, ensuring full compliance with labor laws across various U.S. states and cities.</p>

                            <p>The solution features a robust <strong>ETL pipeline</strong> developed with <strong>Azure Data Factory</strong> and .NET Core services to seamlessly extract, normalize, and cleanse raw time and attendance data ingested from diverse <strong>Point-of-Sale (POS) systems</strong> such as <em>Square</em>, <em>Toast</em>, and <em>Oracle Micros</em>. Data transformation included shift reconciliation, job code classification, and time gap resolution.</p>

                            <p>Using a centralized, configuration-driven rule engine, I implemented dynamic <strong>state-specific compliance logic</strong> covering wage thresholds, overtime calculations, break penalties, and scheduling rules. These configurations were externalized in an <strong>Azure SQL</strong> schema to allow business users to adapt rules without redeployment.</p>

                            <p>The solution also supports a modular <strong>Pay Flow Management System</strong>, allowing finance and HR teams to review, edit, and approve payroll runs via a streamlined UI built in <strong>Angular</strong>. The final output integrates with industry-standard <strong>payroll systems</strong> such as <strong>ADP</strong>, <strong>Paychex</strong>, and <strong>Paylocity</strong> through secured <strong>REST APIs</strong> and <strong>SFTP-based batch exports</strong>.</p>

                            <p>As part of the design, I ensured:

                description: `
            <p>As the <strong>Technical Lead</strong>, I was responsible for architecting and developing a scalable enterprise reporting application for <strong>Dunkin’s intranet ecosystem</strong>. The solution provided advanced analytical capabilities by sourcing operational and strategic data across domains such as <strong>Sales</strong>, <strong>Labor</strong>, <strong>Cost Control</strong>, <strong>Loss Prevention</strong>, and <strong>Guest Satisfaction Surveys</strong>.</p>

            <p>The platform was designed to support multilocation reporting for franchise owners, regional leaders, and executive stakeholders. Using dynamic parameters, users could easily compare metrics like <strong>TY (This Year) vs LY (Last Year)</strong>, <strong>TY vs Budget</strong>, and drill down into trends by region, store, or time period. It served as a unified performance visibility tool across the enterprise network.</p>

            <p>I led the development of several key modules including:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Executive Dashboards</strong> – summarizing key KPIs and YOY comparisons</li>
              <li><strong>Network Reports</strong> – cross-store metrics aligned to ownership and management views</li>
              <li><strong>Alert & Notification Engine</strong> – automatic email triggers based on performance thresholds or anomalies</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The backend leveraged <strong>.NET Framework</strong> and <strong>SQL Server</strong>, with a service layer to integrate ETL outputs and pre-aggregated metrics into the application layer. Reporting pipelines were powered by <strong>ETL frameworks</strong> for data staging, transformation, and aggregation. The frontend was implemented using <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, enabling interactive charts and table visualizations tailored to each role.</p>

            <p>This platform was critical in replacing fragmented reporting sources, delivering a single source of truth across Dunkin's operational ecosystem. I also ensured secure role-based access, performance optimization for high-volume data reads, and data accuracy for executive insights.</p>

            <p>As the <strong>Technical Lead</strong>, I spearheaded the design and development of the <strong>Bonus Application</strong>, a fully automated system for managing and distributing performance-based incentives for store managers. The platform was built to align bonus payouts with real-time operational performance across sales, cost, and service metrics, ensuring fairness, consistency, and transparency in rewards.</p>

            <p>The bonus calculation engine dynamically evaluates eligibility based on a weighted scoring model covering key categories such as:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sales Goals</strong> vs Budget</li>
              <li><strong>Cost Control & Payroll Management</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Guest Satisfaction Scores (GSS)</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Drive-Through Efficiency</strong></li>
            </ul>
            These KPIs are tied to preconfigured thresholds and targets which vary by region or role.</p>

            <p>The final bonus amount is computed as a percentage of the employee's weekly salary and is prorated for the month. All metrics are sourced and processed through integrated <strong>Microservice APIs</strong> that aggregate data from POS, labor, customer feedback, and financial systems.</p>

            <p>The entire lifecycle — from data ingestion and rule evaluation to bonus approval and payroll export — is automated through a workflow built using <strong>.NET Core APIs</strong> and a frontend in <strong>Angular</strong>. Once approved, bonus records are directly submitted to the payroll system for processing.</p>

            <p>Notable design elements include:
            <ul>
              <li>Dynamic bonus configuration engine by store type and performance model</li>
              <li>Role-based UI for regional managers, payroll admins, and executives</li>
              <li>Automated email alerts and submission validations</li>
              <li>Integration with payroll platforms for final payout disbursement</li>

                description: `
    <p>As part of a larger operational excellence initiative, I led the design and delivery of the <strong>Inspection Module</strong>, a configurable restaurant auditing system that enables store managers to perform standardized inspections on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis. The module was built to support dynamic form configuration, real-time scoring, evidence tracking, and automated compliance reporting.</p>

    <p>The solution features a fully dynamic <strong>form builder</strong> that allows administrative users to define <strong>inspection templates</strong> with multiple categories, customizable questions, and flexible input types such as:
